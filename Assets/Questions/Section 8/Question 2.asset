  question: A diver from another buddy team notices I have the new Squid9000 dive
    computer. He asks whether I would trade computers with him for this dive so he
    can check it out.
  answers:
  - No. I should use the same computer on every dive the same day.
  - No. Dive computers adjust for your physiology and will not work for someone else.
  - Yes. It is an excellent way for divers to learn about each others equipment.
  - Yes. I will be able to learn by downloading his dive profile.
