  question: "My buddy and I felt fine before a dive, but after the dive my buddy
    complains about a headache and feeling nauseous. He mentions that his air \u201Ctasted
    funny,\u201D and his lips and fingernail beds look almost cherry red. What condition
    might I suspect, and how would it be avoided?"
  answers:
  - Gas narcosis; don't dive deep
  - Lung overexpansion injury; never hold my breath
  - Contaminated air; have cylinder filled at a reputable pro dive operation
  - Oxygen toxicity; don't dive with a cylinder labeled "oxygen"
