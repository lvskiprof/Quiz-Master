  question: Suppose I feel fine, but may be predisposed to heart attack due to my
    age, lifestyle, body composition, family history or other factors. What should
    I with respect to diving?
  answers:
  - Discuss my situation with my physician to assess the risk and discuss how to
    manage the risk as a diver
  - Begin an intense exercise program that offsets my heart-disease risks
  - Dive very conservatively and reduce my no decompression times by 50 percent
