  question: "One of the divers in the other team has a partially filled BCD, but
    appears significantly overweighted, because he has to kick hard to keep his face
    out of the water. His mask is off and he\u2019s not breathing from his snorkel
    or regulator. Abruptly, he says loudly, \u201CGet me out of this!\u201D He begins
    to splash frantically to stay up. The divemaster yells for him to drop his weights,
    but he doesn\u2019t seem to hear. To help this diver, what is the first thing
    I will do?"
  answers:
  - Tell the diver to relax
  - Establish buoyancy for myself and the diver
  - Help him put his mask back on
