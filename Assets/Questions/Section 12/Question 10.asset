  question: "The black tip reef shark leaves the area, so my buddy and I continue
    to explore. We swim well above the bottom, horizontally with our equipment secure,
    paying attention to what our fins may contact. This helps reduce the likelihood
    of getting an aquatic life injury, and it reduces the chance that we\u2019ll
    accidentally harm an aquatic organism."
