  question: Our first dive was 45 minutes long in 18 metres/60 feet, and we want
    to return to 18 metres/60 feet for at least 30 minutes. To determine how long
    we have to wait before we can make a repetitive dive to 18 metres/60 feet for
    30 minutes, my buddy suggests we check our computers at intervals until they
    show 18 m/60 ft for 30 min. Is this an acceptable way to plan the dive?
